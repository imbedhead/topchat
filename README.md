# TopChat

Join in on your favorite streamer's chat, while easily being able to keep track of messages from special users!

## What is it?

Chat can go fast sometimes.  If you're trying to read what mods are saying, or see what other popular streamers are here, those messages can get buried if chat is spamming emotes.

That's where TopChat comes in. TopChat will load in the regular Twitch chat you're used to, along with a separate list of messages from "Elevated Users".

## Elevated Users?
Any Mod, VIP, Partner, or the current Broadcaster.

## How do I use it?

Search for the streamer's chat you want to join, and then an embedded Twitch will appear, using whichever account you are currently logged into on Twitch.tv.  Any external emote extensions you may have installed will appear in the embedded chat. The separate list (the Top Chat) will display messages from those elevated users, with all BTTV, 7TV, FFZ, and channel emotes!
